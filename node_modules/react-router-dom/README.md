# React Router DOM

The `react-router-dom` package contains bindings for using [React
Router](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router) in web applications.
Please see [the Getting Started guide](https://reactrouter.com/v6/start/tutorial) for more information on how to get started with React Router.
=======
This package simply re-exports everything from `react-router` to smooth the upgrade path for v6 applications. Once upgraded you can change all of your imports and remove it from your dependencies:

```diff
-import { Routes } from "react-router-dom"
+import { Routes } from "react-router"
```
